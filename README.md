===================

Github definitely has better names for my projects than I do.  This is a GLFW/GLU based experiment.  Currently, it only has a terrain generation scene, but will have other things later.

Compiling
---------
Use cmake.  Depends on GL, GLFW, GLU, FTGL, ASSIMP and GLM

        cmake .
        make
        sudo make install
