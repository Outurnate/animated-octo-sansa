===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephd/animated-octo-sansa.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josephd/animated-octo-sansa)

Github definitely has better names for my projects than I do.  This is a GLFW based experiment.  Currently, it only is terrain generation scene.

Compiling
---------
Use cmake.  Depends on GL, GLFW, GLEW, DevIL, FTGL, ASSIMP and GLM

        cmake .
        make
        sudo make install
